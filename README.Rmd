# cheese

The goal of `cheese` is to facilitiate appreciation of the culinary culture of cheesemaking through data analysis of the largest collection of cheeses from www.cheese.com

## Installation

You can install the development version of `cheese` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dmi3kno/cheese")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(cheese)
cheese
```

Note that because it is a data package, it is documented with `devtools::document()` and not with `roxygen2::roxygenize()`
